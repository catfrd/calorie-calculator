                <h3>keto diet</h3>
                <p>The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate dietary therapy that in
                    conventional medicine is used mainly to treat hard-to-control (refractory) epilepsy in children. The
                    diet forces the body to burn fats rather than carbohydrates.
                    Example foods for the ketogenic diet are keto breads, animal proteins, vegetables and other
                    fruit-based foods.</p>

                <h3>protien diet</h3>
                <p>A diet in which 20% or more of the total daily calories comes from protein. Most high protein
                    diets are high in saturated fat and severely restrict intake of carbohydrates.

                    Example foods in a high-protein diet include lean beef, chicken or poultry, pork, salmon and tuna,
                    eggs, and soy. High-protein diets have been criticized as a type of fad diet and for promoting
                    misconceptions about carbohydrates, insulin resistance and ketosis.</p>

                    plants. Vegans do not eat foods that come from animals, including dairy products and eggs.</p>
